# prompt-notes
A simple program that lets you add a short note to your command line prompt.

# Idea

The idea is that sometimes you want to note down something quick and short to remember while working. For me, the most visible place is the command line prompt, since it's always there. This means having a note there is quite annoying, so it's motivating to get rid of it. 

# Implementation

Need to look at how command line prompts are changed (I know some tools do this to show various other information). Is it just about modifying the PS1 variable and sourcing?
